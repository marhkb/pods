      <li>Easily overview images, containers and pods.</li>
      <li>View prepared information about images, containers, and pods.</li>
      <li>Inspect images, containers and pods.</li>
      <li>View and search container logs.</li>
      <li>Monitor processes of containers and pods.</li>
      <li>Download images and build them using Dockerfiles.</li>
      <li>Create pods and containers.</li>
      <li>Control the lifecycle of containers and pods (in bulk) (start, stop, pause, etc.).</li>
      <li>Delete images, containers, and pods (in bulk).</li>
      <li>Prune images.</li>
      <li>Rename containers.</li>
